# Maze Solver
<p>This project is a maze solver implemented in Python. It supports three different algorithms: depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and A*.<\p>

## Usage
<p> To use the maze solver, simply create a new Maze object and pass the filename of the maze file to the constructor. The maze file should be in a simple text format, with each line representing a row of the maze. The walls of the maze are represented by the # character, and the start and goal states are represented by the S and E characters, respectively.

Once you have created a Maze object, you can call the solve() method to solve the maze. This method will return a list of actions that can be taken to traverse the maze from the start state to the goal state.

You can also use the output_image() method to generate an image of the maze, with the solution path highlighted. <\p>

## Example
<p> The following code shows how to use the maze solver to solve a simple maze: <\p>
